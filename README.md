# Roetur

A lightwieight OWIN-based API framework.

## You've spelt Router wrong!

No I haven't. It's a bit of an "in joke" really. I've worked with a lot of people who create mis-spelled classes/methods/messages and for once I wanted to do some mis-spelling. It also drives ReSpeller (a plug-in for ReSharper) a bit mad.
